Then for selected coin you can run more detailed report that shows maximum drawdown, number of profit and losing days and more...

Another useful visualization is monthly return per coin. Each buble represent one month so if 5 years in a row there was negative return in January, you can expect another negative January this year... It is not 100 % as always, but at least you have something to work with...

Same thing for Daily returns. Idea is that when coin moved certain percentage already, you know it is more likely to push back or stay then it is to move any further today based on historical movements.
